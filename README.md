# Subject-Matter-Expert-AI-Agent
This Major Project requires the design, implementation, and documentation of a highly
extensible Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of serving as a
subject-matter expert (SME). The focus is on Agentic Capabilities, RAG, Workflow, and
Tool Calling.
The system is designed to act as an Environmental Science SME Agent, assisting users
with queries related to pollution control, biodiversity conservation, climate change, and
sustainability. It emphasizes robust question-answering based on retrieved data, with
workflows for multi-step reasoning.
For the mid-evaluation, this report covers everything up to Embedding & Indexing,
including data collection, preprocessing, chunking, embedding generation, and design
choices. No vector databases were used for indexing in this phase; embeddings are
stored locally for further development and finding free sources.
